<h1>The Best Shows According to Charmaine</h1>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. The themes and symbolism are very well done.</p>
<h3>Arcane</h3>
<p>Breath-taking animation and extremely well written story.</p>
<h3>The Master's Sun</h3>
<p>One of the few K-dramas that has very few plot holes and is extremely enjoyable to watch from start to finish.</p>
